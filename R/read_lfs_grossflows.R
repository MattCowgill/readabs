#' Download, import and tidy 'gross flows' data cube
#' from the monthly ABS Labour Force survey.
#'
#' This convenience function downloads, imports and tidies the 'gross flows' data
#' cube from the monthly ABS Labour Force survey. The gross flows data cube (GM1)
#' shows estimates of the number of people who
#' transitioned from one labour force status to another between two months.
#'
#' @param weights either `"current"` or `"previous"`. If `"current"`, figures will
#' use the current month's Labour Force survey weights; if `"previous"`, the
#' previous month's weights are used.
#' @param path Local directory in which downloaded files should be stored.
#' By default, 'path' takes the value set in the environment variable
#' "R_READABS_PATH". If this variable is not set, any files downloaded
#' will be stored in a temporary directory (`tempdir()`).
#' See `Details` in \code{?read_abs} for more information.
#' @return A tibble containing data cube GM1 from the monthly Labour Force survey.
