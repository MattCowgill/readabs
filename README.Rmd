## Overview
readabs helps you easily download, import, and tidy time series data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics from within R. This saves you time manually downloading and
tediously tidying time series data and allows you to spend more time on your 
analysis.

We'd welcome Github issues containing error reports or feature requests. 
Alternatively you can email the package maintainer at mattcowgill at gmail dot com.

## Installation

Install the latest CRAN version of **readabs** with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readabs")
```

You can install the developer version of **readabs** from GitHub with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# if you don't have devtools installed, first run:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattcowgill/readabs")
```

## Usage

There are two key functions in **readabs**. They are:

* `read_abs()` downloads, imports, and tidies time series data from the ABS website.
* `read_abs_local()` imports and tidies time series data from ABS spreadsheets stored on a local drive.

Both functions return a single tidy data frame (tibble) containing long data.

## Examples

To download all the time series data from an ABS catalogue number to your disk, and import the data to R as a single tidy data frame, use `read_abs()`. Here's an example with the Wage Price Index, catalogue number 6345.0:

```{r all-wpi}
library(readabs)

all_wpi <- read_abs("6345.0")

str(all_wpi)
```

Maybe you only want a particular table? Here's how you get a single table:

```{r wpi1}

wpi_t1 <- read_abs("6345.0", tables = 1)
```

If you want multiple tables, but not the whole catalogue, that's easy too:

```{r wpi1_5}

wpi_t1_t5 <- read_abs("6345.0", tables = c("1", "5a"))

```

For more examples, see the readabs vignette (run `browseVignettes("readabs")`.

## Package history
From version 0.3.0, `readabs` gained new functionality. Pre-0.3.0 functions still work,
but `read_abs_data()` is soft-deprecated and the behaviour of `read_abs_metadata()`
has changed. The old version of `readabs` is available in the [0.2.9 branch on Github](https://github.com/MattCowgill/readabs/tree/0.2.9).
