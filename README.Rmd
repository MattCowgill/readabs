## Overview
{readabs} helps you easily download, import, and tidy data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics within R. 
This saves you time manually downloading and tediously tidying data and allows you to spend more time on your analysis.

## Installation

Install the latest CRAN version of {readabs} with:

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("readabs")
```

You can install the development version of {readabs} from GitHub with:
```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# if you don't have devtools installed, first run:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattcowgill/readabs")
```

## Usage

The main function in {readabs} is `read_abs()`, which downloads, imports, and tidies time series data from the ABS website.

There are some other functions you may find useful.

* `read_abs_local()` imports and tidies time series data from ABS spreadsheets stored on a local drive. Thanks to Hugh Parsonage for contributing to this functionality.
* `separate_series()` splits the `series` column of a tidied ABS time series spreadsheet into multiple columns, reducing the manual wrangling that's needed to work with the data. Thanks to David Diviny for writing this function.
* `download_abs_data_cube()` downloads a data cube (ie. non-time series spreadsheet) from the ABS website. Thanks to David Diviny for writing this function.
* `read_cpi()` imports the Consumer Price Index numbers as a two-column tibble: `date` and `cpi`. This is useful for joining to other series to adjust data for changes in consumer prices.
* `read_payrolls()` downloads, imports, and tidies tables from the ABS Weekly Payroll Jobs dataset.


## Using read_abs()

To download all the time series data from an ABS catalogue number to your disk, and import the data to R as a single tidy data frame, use `read_abs()`. 

First we'll load {readabs} and the {tidyverse}:
```{r load-packages, results=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readabs)
library(tidyverse)
```

Now we'll create one data frame that contains all the time series data from the Wage Price Index, catalogue number 6345.0:

```{r all-wpi}
all_wpi <- read_abs("6345.0")
```

This is what it looks like:

```{r str-wpi}
str(all_wpi)
```

It only takes you a few lines of code to make a graph from your data:

```{r all-in-one-example}
all_wpi %>%
  filter(series == "Percentage Change From Corresponding Quarter of Previous Year ;  Australia ;  Total hourly rates of pay excluding bonuses ;  Private and Public ;  All industries ;",
         !is.na(value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value, col = series_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Annual wage growth (per cent)")

```


In the example above we downloaded all the time series from a catalogue number. This will often be overkill. If you know the data you need is in a particular table, you can just get that table like this:

```{r wpi1}
wpi_t1 <- read_abs("6345.0", tables = 1)
```

If you want multiple tables, but not the whole catalogue, that's easy too:

```{r wpi1_5}
wpi_t1_t5 <- read_abs("6345.0", tables = c("1", "5a"))
```

In most cases, the `series` column will contain multiple components, separated by ';'. The `separate_series()` function can help wrangling this column.

For more examples, please see the readabs vignette (run `browseVignettes("readabs")`).
