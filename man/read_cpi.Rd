\title{Download a tidy tibble containing the Consumer Price Index from the ABS}
\usage{
read_cpi(
  path = Sys.getenv("R_READABS_PATH", unset = tempdir()),
  show_progress_bars = TRUE,
  check_local = FALSE,
  retain_files = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{character; default is "data/ABS". Only used if
retain_files is set to TRUE. Local directory in which to save
downloaded ABS time series spreadsheets.}

\item{show_progress_bars}{logical; TRUE by default. If set to FALSE, progress
bars will not be shown when ABS spreadsheets are downloading.}

\item{check_local}{logical; FALSE by default. See \code{?read_abs}.}

\item{retain_files}{logical; FALSE by default. When TRUE, the spreadsheets
downloaded from the ABS website will be saved in the
directory specified with 'path'.}
}
\description{
\code{read_cpi()} uses the \code{read_abs()} function to download, import,
and tidy the Consumer Price Index from the ABS. It returns a tibble
containing two columns: the date and the CPI index value that corresponds
to that date. This makes joining the CPI to another dataframe easy.
\code{read_cpi()} returns the original (ie. not seasonally adjusted)
all groups CPI for Australia. If you want the analytical series
(eg. seasonally adjusted CPI, or trimmed mean CPI), you can use
\code{read_abs()}.
}
\examples{

# Create a tibble called 'cpi' that contains the CPI index
# numbers for each quarter
\donttest{
cpi <- read_cpi()
}

# This tibble can now be joined to another to help streamline the process of
# deflating nominal values.
}
