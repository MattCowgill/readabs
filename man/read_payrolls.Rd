\usage{
read_payrolls(
  series = c("industry_jobs", "industry_wages", "sa4_jobs", "sa3_jobs",
    "subindustry_jobs", "empsize_jobs", "gccsa_jobs", "sex_age_jobs"),
  path = Sys.getenv("R_READABS_PATH", unset = tempdir())

}
\arguments{
\item{series}{Character. Must be one of:
\itemize{
 \item{"industry_jobs"}{ Payroll jobs by industry division, state, sex, and age
 group (Table 4)}
 \item{"industry_wages"}{ Total wages by industry division, state, sex, and age
 group (Table 4)}
 \item{"sa4_jobs"}{ Payroll jobs by statistical area 4 (SA4) and state (Table 5)}
 \item{"sa3_jobs}{ Payroll jobs by statistical area 4 (SA4), statistical
 area 3 (SA3), and state (Table 5)}
 \item{"subindustry_jobs"}{ Payroll jobs by industry sub-division and
 industry division (Table 6)}
 \item{"empsize_jobs"}{ Payroll jobs by size of employer (number of
 employees) and state (Table 7)}
 \item{"gccsa_jobs"}{ Payroll jobs by Greater Capital City Statistical
 Area (Table 5)}
 \item{"sex_age_jobs}{ Payroll jobs by sex and age (Table 8)}
}
The default is "industry_jobs".}

\item{path}{Local directory in which downloaded ABS time series
spreadsheets should be stored. By default, `path` takes the value set in the
environment variable "R_READABS_PATH". If this variable is not set,
any files downloaded by read_abs()  will be stored in a temporary directory
(\code{tempdir()}).}
}
\value{
A tidy (long) `tbl_df`. The number of columns differs based on the `series`.
}
\description{
Import a tidy tibble of ABS Weekly Payrolls data.
}
\details{
The ABS 'Weekly Payroll Jobs and Wages in Australia' dataset
is very useful to analysts of the Australian labour market.
It draws upon data collected
by the Australian Taxation Office as part of its Single-Touch Payroll
initiative and supplements the monthly Labour Force Survey. Unfortunately,
the data as published by the ABS (1) is not in a standard time series
spreadsheet; and (2) is messy in various ways that make it hard to
read in R. This convenience function uses `download_abs_data_cube()` to
import the payrolls data, and then tidies it up.
